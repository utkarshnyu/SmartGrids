# SmartGrids


We did a dual-ascent optimization with data from local nodes and integrated the execution in smart contracts running on ethereum blockchain.
The goal of the project was to simulate a p2p energy trading econmy where users can trade among themselves withouth the need of any central entity.
The Dapp allows for nodes to verify data at all the other nodes at every time t with the help of private key.
